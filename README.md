Hello there,

## React-assignment-2

I have used material-ui to add icons in this project, In this project I was tasked to build a project using the API:https://api.tjori.com/api/v7filters/na/women-all-products/?f_page=1&format=json but since the API was not working, I have used the images and data from the figma file to build the project and displayed the first Assignment API's data which is :https://admin.tomedes.com/api/v1/get-reviews?page=1 to display that I can use the axiom NPM package to get data.

here's the netlify deployment link:https://main--papaya-starlight-740448.netlify.app/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
